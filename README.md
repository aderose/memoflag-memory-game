# MemoFlag

A simple memory game in which the user selects on a displayed flags.

- When a flag is selected, the game board shuffles and the score increments.
- If the same flag is selected twice in a row, the flags and scores are reset. A new "Top Score" is set based on your previous score.

The game was created using React.
